# Taxist App ©

_When the app is opened_, it requests permission to access the user’s location, so it can later be used as the starting point.

Once the permission is granted, the user can select the starting point and destination, and then press the button to see the route, as well as the delivery price (if the trip is less than 15 km and a driver has been selected). If a driver hasn’t been selected but the route is set, the price will automatically appear once a driver is chosen and will adjust based on the driver.

To select a driver, the user needs to tap on the "Select Driver" text in the top-right corner, after which the driver selection menu will appear. To choose a driver, simply click on the driver’s card. To see more information about the driver, double-click or long-press the driver’s card.

At the bottom of the driver menu, there is a search system that allows you to find drivers based on parameters such as car body type, driver's name, car model, or price.

If something is unclear, you can click on the exclamation mark in the bottom-right corner, and additional information will be displayed.

If there is no internet connection, the app will display a connection error, which will disappear once the connection is restored.

App Fully supports German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, and Ukrainian languages.

The first time you run it, there may be problems (Google starts the app in safe mode because the app is unknown), then just **restart** the app.
